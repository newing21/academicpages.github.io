Business Analyst/Data Science professional with 3+ years of experience leading financial forecasting analysis, market development, E-commerce, and customer engagement research projects.  Proven track record in translating data into actionable insights and managing team productivity.  

I received my undergraduate degrees in Economics and Chinese from the University of Iowa, where I served as a Global Engagement Student Advisor for the Tippie College of Business.  I then lived, studied, and worked in Asia, attending National Taiwan University and reaching fluency in Mandarin Chinese.  As a Senior Business Analyst at C K International, LTD., I consulted on issues surrounding international trade and developed statistical models, presenting analysis directly to Executive Directore, key vendors, and business stakeholders.  As a graduate student, I've sharpened my analytical decision making and completed coursework in Data Science, Information Visualization, R-Programming, SQL, Python, Text Analytics, and Social Analytics.
