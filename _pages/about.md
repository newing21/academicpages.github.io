I'm a Product Manager with 5+ years of experience in Digital Transformation, AI/ML, Finance, and the Telecom space. I've launched innovative products and created digital-first user experiences for Fortune 500 companies and multinational food processing conglomerates.

In 2021, I helped co-found the Mental Health Community Engagement Program (MCHEP), a mental health focused research incubator aimed at identifying and addressing gaps in coverage and care. Through partnerships and working in collaboration with the Colorado School of Medicine, NAMI Colorado and 2040 Partners for Health, our goal is to improve physician training on mental health.

Having lived, worked, and studied in the US and China, I like to think of myself as a global citizen and enjoy connecting with new people. I have reached working proficiency in Mandarin Chinese, am currently learning Vietnamese, and hope to leverage these language skills in the workplace.

I get excited about opportunities where Iâ€™m able to work with highly creative people and deliver cutting-edge industry solutions on a global scale.
