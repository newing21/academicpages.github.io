I am a product Manager with 5+ years of experience in digital transformation, AI/ML, finance, and the telecom space. I've helped companies like New Balance, DISH Network, Boost Mobile, and multinational food processing conglomerates launch innovative products and create personalized, digital-first user experiences.  

Most recently, I helped co-found a mental health related program aimed at identifying and mitigating gaps in our mental health care system.  I've served as the lead analyst and an advisor, performing NLP on publicly available mental health related testimonies.  

I'm passionate about solving the world's most intractable problems and am particularly interested in financial inclusion, the intersection of mental health and technology, EVs, cloud computing, and machine learning.  I would like to transition to a product / strategy role at a fast-growing, mission-driven tech company to pursue these passions.  

Having lived, worked, and studied in the US and China, I like to think of myself as a global citizen and enjoy connecting with new people.  I have reached working proficiency in Mandarin Chinese and am currently learning Vietnamese.  

Additionally, I'm a massive soccer fan (Glory glory Tottenham Hotspur!) and enjoy learning. To learn about NLP and international relations, I built ML models to analyze sentiment expressed in 350,000 distinct tweets, evaluating the social media-based influence campaign carried out by the CCP. Results can be found at github.com/newing21.

I get excited about opportunities where I'm able to work with highly creative people and deliver cutting-edge industry solutions on a global scale.
