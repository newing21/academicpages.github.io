Product Manager with 5+ years of experience in digital transformation, FinTech, and the telecom space. I help companies like DISH and Boost Mobile implement digital strategies and am responsible for growing digital adoption rate by 33%q/q.

Previously, I advised clients in the B2B market in Greater China, Japan, and US on overall strategy and operations, including multinational corporations and conglomerates. 

Examples of my work include:

- Coordinated with stakeholders to identify and mitigate customer pain points, achieving an 8% increase in user containment rate in one month. 

- Managed customer outreach initiatives for clients in the B2B market in greater China, Japan, and the US, increasing customer base by 110% YOY in 2018. 

- Built Python-based ML models to analyze customer sentiment in 300,000+ reviews, identifying customer pain points at an 87% accuracy level. 

- Fluent in English and Mandarin Chinese, learning Vietnamese. 

I'm a massive soccer fan (Glory glory Tottenham Hotspur!) and enjoy learning. To learn about NLP and international relations, I built ML models to analyze sentiment expressed in 350,000 distinct tweets, evaluating the social media-based influence campaign carried out by the CCP. Results can be found at github.com/newing21.

I get excited about opportunities where I'm able to work with highly creative people and deliver cutting-edge industry solutions on a global scale.
