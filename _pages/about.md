A highly motivated, data-driven analyst, I received my undergraduate degrees in Economics and Chinese from the University of Iowa, where I served as a Global Engagement Student Advisor for the Tippie College of Business.  I then lived, studied, and worked in Asia, where I attended National Taiwan University on the Huayu Enrichment Scholarship, reaching fluency in Mandarin Chinese.  As a Senior Business Development Analyst at C K International, LTD., I consulted on issues surrounding international trade and developed forecasting models, contributing to operational success.  As a graduate student, I've sharpened my analytical decision making and completed coursework in Data Science, Information Visualization, Corporate Financial Reporting, and Social Analytics.  

I enjoy constantly learning and am challenging myself by learning Vietnamese and conducting research on US-China relations.  My interests include hiking, biking, soccer, history, international policy, and engaging with the community.  I currently serve as a Facilitator for Girls Who Code and constalty seek opportunities to enrich the local community.
