/* This file is a compatability layer.  It allows the usage of flexible box 
model layouts accross multiple browsers, including older browsers.  The newest,
universal implementation of the flexible box model is used when available (see
`Modern browsers` comments below).  Browsers that are known to implement this 
new spec completely include:

    Firefox 28.0+
    Chrome 29.0+
    Internet Explorer 11+ 
    Opera 17.0+

Browsers not listed, including Safari, are supported via the styling under the

 &#39;Let’s see if it works.&#39;,
 &#39;These benefits are not forever.&#39;,
 &#39;Probably, manufacturers will go to Asia and Africa in future.” Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has promised an economic rescue package worth 108 trillion yen ($990 billion), or around 20 percent of the country’s gross domestic product, to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.The money includes $2.3 billion to “reform supply chains,” including $2 billion to help companies move production back to Japan and $215 million to help those “seeking to diversify production bases” to other countries, according to details posted by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.China is Japan’s biggest trading partner, but imports from China slumped by almost half in February, after factories there were closed to curb the spread of the virus, disrupting supplies of vital components to Japanese manufacturers, Bloomberg reported.The World Trade Organization said this week that the virus had already badly undermined global trade, but warned the impact will be greater “in sectors characterized by complex value chain linkages, particularly in electronics and automotive products.” By Simon DenyerApril 9, 2020 at 3:13 AM EDTRunners may be exposing themselves even when 6 feet apart, study saysThe rule is now familiar, if not utterly routine, for anyone who has ventured outdoors in the middle of the pandemic: Whether walking the dog, buying groceries or taking out the trash, you should stay more than six feet apart to contain the novel coronavirus.But anyone who goes outside to exercise may need to keep an even greater distance from other runners and joggers, a new European study says, to properly practice social distancing.Researchers at KU Leuven in Belgium and the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands found that someone infected with the virus could pass on respiratory droplets to people more than six feet behind them through a kind of vacuum they form as they cut through the air.“When you are moving — running, cycling, walking — you are actually creating an area behind you that is often called a slipstream,” Bert Blocken, who coordinated the study, told the Brussels Times.Athletes often use these slipstreams to run or bike at a higher speed, Blocken said.According to simulations run by his team, a jogger moving at about 2.5 miles per hour was likely to come into contact with the slipstream, and thus, the droplets, of someone exercising as much as 50 feet ahead.The study suggests that runners and cyclists may want to avoid moving directly behind another person and falling into their slipstream, Blocken said, by moving side by side or in a staggered formation.When such a formation is unavoidable on narrow paths or sidewalks, those seeking an outdoor workout should stay at least 15 feet apart when walking, 33 feet when running or cycling slowly and 65 feet apart for more vigorous exercise, he told the Globe and Mail.By Teo ArmusApril 9, 2020 at 3:07 AM EDTAustralian police seize Ruby Princess ‘black box’ after surge in infections linked to ship Police in Australia have seized the “black box” from the Ruby Princess cruise ship, days after launching a criminal investigation into the vessel that has been linked to hundreds of confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the country.The ship, operated by Carnival Australia, docked in Sydney last month.&#39;,

 &#39;Stewart Patrick, a senior fellow at the Center on Foreign Relations, correctly points out that even if the WHO did commit early missteps on China, it righted itself as more data came in.Indeed, the WHO declared an international public health emergency on Jan. 30, right around the time of Trump’s travel restrictions.&#39;,
 &#39;Now an influential model from the University of Washington projects “only” 61,545 coronavirus deaths.&#39;,
 &#39;On the other, there are the measures recommend by scientific experts.&#39;,
 &#39;When White House officials began speaking with people in Silicon Valley about leveraging location data to combat the coronavirus, which was first reported by The Washington Post in March, it sparked widespread privacy concerns.ADADFor now, some U.S. officials are working with academics, researchers and tech companies to harness anonymous location information to study social distancing.&#39;,
 &#39;“I can’t guarantee that, but the countries I’m more worried about are where there’s a lot of transportation back and forth with China and depleted health systems.”How do you treat this coronavirus illness?There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for this infection.&#39;,
 &#39;Larry Hogan ordered nonessential businesses to shut down at 5 p.m. Monday, the latest restriction in recent weeks to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus.“Unless you have essential reason to leave your house, then you should stay in your home,” he said.The governor said he is fighting “twin battles” as he weighs the lingering impact the outbreak could have on the state’s economy and the toll the deadly virus could have on Marylanders.&#39;,
 &#39;It’s going to take a while.&#39;,
 &#39;In late January, he was insisting that everything would “work out well” in the United States and insisting that only five people in the country had the virus.&#39;,
 &#39;&#34;ADTrump administration wants hundreds of thousands of federal workers to be ready to telework full timeBaiden King lost her job at Carson’s Cookie Fix bakery in Omaha on Tuesday because online sales and customer traffic dried up dramatically — especially after the state’s first case of covid-19 was reported nearby.&#39;,
 &#39;“To completely ignore it was a bit disrespectful.”Atlanta’s Fulton County had closed its 93,500-student school district after a teacher tested positive, and Ross was hearing from stressed parents who had to scramble for child care or stay home from work.&#39;,
 &#39;Abandoning a broader sense of the common good, theirs is a faith that pits “us against them,” and God is always on their side.At a moment when the nation is facing an unprecedented threat to public health, the limits of this faith are evident.&#39;,
 &#39;That poses serious cyber dangers.As coronavirus infections mount, the federal government is preparing for an unprecedented experiment in remote working that brings with it a slew of digital dangers.The Trump administration is ordering hundreds of thousands of federal employees to be prepared to telework full time if the virus spread worsens, as my colleague Lisa Rein reports.&#39;,
 &#39;Some patients will have much more access to testing than others.&#39;,
 &#39;We are one family,” Beyoncé added.&#39;,
 &#39;The grand jury issued this subpoena last August, and its investigation would be incomplete without the requested documents, yet it is now almost April and it hasn’t received them.In short, these cases must be decided quickly to ensure that Trump is not able to run out the clock and that Congress and the grand jury receive the documents they need to conduct time-sensitive investigations.&#39;,
 &#39;“Game changer” was the preferred term of Trump, even though top coronavirus adviser Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, cautioned that accounts of the drug’s utility were merely “anecdotal.&#39;,

 &#39;The prime minister thanked private initiatives, including the use of 3-D printers, to create health supplies nationally given what he called “an aggressive and very competitive international market” for the urgently needed material.By Pamela RolfeMarch 22, 2020 at 12:16 PM EDTEmirates suspends most passenger flights as UAE tightens restrictionsDUBAI — The flagship carrier of the United Arab Emirates announced Sunday that it would suspend all passenger flights by Wednesday in response to the novel coronavirus, but it issued a new statement hours later that suggested it would keep some routes open.“As a global network airline, we find ourselves in a situation where we cannot viably operate passenger services until countries reopen their borders, and travel confidence returns,” said Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum, chairman and chief executive of the Emirates Group.Emirates will retain cargo flights but implement a three-month basic salary cut to avoid layoffs.&#39;,
