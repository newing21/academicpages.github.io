### Overview

As US-China relations continue to fracture, Beijing backed representatives are turning towards the Trump administration’s favorite tool – Twitter – to shape public opinion.   The sharp uptick in usage has signaled a coordinated effort to leverage western social media and promulgate state-views, often pertaining to sensitive domestic topics.  

While Beijing’s foray into western-owned social media is relatively new, attempts to shape attitudes of young American minds is not.  Confucius Institutes, international economic development initiatives and increasingly Tik-Tok, a burgeoning social media platform owned by Chinese company ByteDance, have been the main vehicles in disseminating views.  However, a prevailing theme to these mechanisms is that each are Chinese owned, and Chinese funded, providing elevated degrees of authority and censorship.  

The Twitter-based influence operation marks the first time the Chinese Communist Party has conducted a large-scale campaign on a foreign owned platform.  But have they been successful?
